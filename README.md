# WEB-DesignStudio
Purpose: This website was an assignment for an Advanced Web Design course. A photoshop file was provided and used as a guide to build this website from scratch.

The 'contact' links in the home page body and navigation bar are functional. 

**Commit history is unavailable for this project as it was moved from a seperate directory.**
